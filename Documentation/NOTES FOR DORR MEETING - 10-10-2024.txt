Executive Summary: (Noah)


Meets requirements for content, but the last paragraph should be moved to the top of the document in order to present the information in "newspaper format" and also
needs to be adjusted to meet this new arrangement


Functionality: (Kirk, later rewritten by Blake)

Section meets the requirements laid out in the rubric, and does not add any unnecessary information


Inputs and Outputs: (Blake)

The third paragraph might have some unnecessary fluff involving the signal processing. Could potentially be condensed to just focus on the electrical connections.
Should include specific declarations for I/O of the whole system. Think JST connector, USB, SPI etc. A diagram would work well to showcase this

Use Case: (Kelly)

-describes potential use cases, but does not refer to specific I/O or switches present in any diagram.
-no mention of how users interact with display screen, GUI, or other I/O within a diagram
-no confidence for reader to use the device. Should explain how the user inputs signals through muscles, and how those can be processed and displayed or actuated

Physical Description and User Interface: (Kelly)

-no actual dimensions present involved in this section. Should include a diagram or picture of how electrodes are to be placed on the arm, no sketch of casing or
actual system
-no example screens for a GUI, i.e the Unity window


Development and Procurement: (Kirk and Jayden)

-no detailed technical justifications for our choices in procured parts
- no specific information on how these parts interact. More detail on the PCB.. layers, dimension. How does TFLite model interact with the system? How do you program
stm32?

Specifications: (Jayden)

-states I/O and specs correctly, but the performance metrics show no actual values. for instance, sEMG electrode array
shows "Sampling Rate (Hz)" Where it should include *specific* values. For sEMG it would be 2khz sampling rate etc

Validation, and System Test: (Noah)

-unnecessary information about the pretrained network. Also unnecessary details about power supply design can be
streamlined to focus on how to test it during a system test
-maximum coverage not met, because it does not specify that multiple users will be used
-battery life test should be explicitly stated
